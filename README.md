# sparkinfer-runtime

Edge AI inference runtime for **NVIDIA RTX Spark** and RTX 5090-class GPUs.

## Primary Target: NVIDIA RTX Spark

RTX Spark is NVIDIA's Blackwell-based AI superchip: 20-core ARM CPU + Blackwell GPU + **128 GB unified LPDDR5X memory** in a single package. It runs 120B-parameter models locally and delivers ~1 PFLOP of AI compute — making it the first consumer-grade platform where datacenter-scale MoE inference is native.

**Why RTX Spark changes the runtime problem:**

| Before (cloud/datacenter era) | RTX Spark era |
|---|---|
| Optimize for TP=8, batch=1024 | Optimize for single-node, batch=1–64 |
| Memory bandwidth = HBM (3+ TB/s) | Memory bandwidth = LPDDR5X (~273 GB/s) |
| Expert eviction = rare | Expert scheduling = critical |
| KV cache = secondary concern | KV cache = primary memory pressure |
| vLLM / SGLang sufficient | New runtime layer required |

## Hardware Targets

| Device | Memory | Bandwidth | Arch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **RTX Spark** | 128 GB unified | ~273 GB/s | sm_100 | **Primary** |
| RTX 5090 | 32 GB GDDR7 | 1.79 TB/s | sm_100 | Secondary |
| Jetson Thor | TBD | TBD | sm_100 | Planned |

## What This Runtime Does

Standard serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang) are designed for distributed datacenter inference — tensor parallelism across multiple GPUs, large batch throughput, HBM-class bandwidth. On RTX Spark, those assumptions break:

- No TP — everything runs on one chip
- Unified memory means CPU and GPU share the same pool — expert weights don't need PCIe transfer
- LPDDR5X bandwidth (~273 GB/s) is 6–7× lower than GDDR7 — memory layout and scheduling matter more than raw kernel FLOPS
- Interactive latency targets (< 50 ms TTFT) require a latency-first scheduler, not a throughput-first one

This runtime is built specifically for that environment.

## Target Models

| Model | Total / Active | Q4_K_M Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.5-35B-A3B | 35B / 3B | ~20 GB | 256 experts, 2 KV heads |
| Gemma 4 26B-A4B | 26B / 4B | ~14.6 GB | Interleaved local/global attn, head_dim=512 |

Both fit in RTX Spark's 128 GB unified memory with significant headroom for KV cache.
